## SUMMARY
This NodeJS project uses MVC architecture with Express underspinning. This can be used as a boilerplate to start a new NodeJS project.

## WHERE TO START

### Prerequisites
- Node
- NPM
- Bower
- Gulp
- PostgreSQL: This can be changed in the config/env/{{name}}.json. **NOTE**: Please change the database name and user account before running the application.

### Commands
Depending on which OS your computer is running on, you might set NODE_ENV differently. For example, it would be `NODE_ENV=development gulp run` on MacOS or Linux. On Windows machines, it would be `set NODE_ENV=development && gulp run`.


- `npm install`: This installs all the node dependencies. This should be run before the other commands.
- `bower install`: This installs bower components.
- `gulp run`: This starts up the server. You can then open http://localhost:3000.
- `gulp test`: This is supposed to run all the test cases.
- `gulp db`: This does all the database migration jobs. All available options are below:

	- `gulp db --make <name_of_the_migration>`
	- `gulp db --migrate`
	- `gulp db --rollback`
	- `gulp db --version`

- `node bin/www`: This starts up the server like `gulp run` but doesn't prepare css, javascript and layout files.
- `npm run test-server`: Just another way of running test.

### Coding Conventions
For this project, I'm following general rules/conventions such as `__variable__` is a hidden/private variable. The same is applied for naming file. For example, `config/__bootstrapServer__.js` and `config/__bootstrapProject__.js` are not to be used independently but will be called in `config/bootstrap.js`.

### Configurations
All the configuration files are saved under config/env. Depending on which environment you are passing from the command line, it picks up the file with the matching name such as test.json or development.json

#### Loading order
The following files are used in the same order of setting up the environment.

1. \_\_{env}__.json
2. {env}.json
3. default.json

In other words, for any given key, it first checks in the `__{env}__.json` file and then the others. The reason of using `__{env}__.json` file is that developers can put their account username and password there without worrying them being checked into git and shared with others.

Just have a quick look into `.gitignore` files, you can find this line `config/env/__*__.json`.

#### Special Cases
- `rootLogFolder` is prefixed with `Project.ROOT_FOLDER`
- `logFolder` is `rootLogFolder` + '/' + `env`
- `appLogFolder` is `logFolder` + 'app'. This is used to store application logged messages.
- `accessLogFolder` is `logFolder` + 'access'. It mimics the Apache http access log.
- `gulp`: any properties under this is prefixed with `Project.ROOT_FOLDER` if its name ends with 'Folder'

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

### Model View Controller
This project follows the MVC architecture with the key directories listed below:

- frontend/views: Where views are defined. The current templating engine being used is [Handlebars].
- server/models: the model part
- server/routes: the controller part

### The Core
Before going further, let's have a deeper understanding of the core of the project. `config/bootstrap.js` is the heart of this project. There are a number of ways to `require` this module. It gives you an instance of Project setting object. The Project setting object has access to all configurations, Models and Services. Given `var ProjectJS= require('config/bootstrap.js')`, we can have:

- `ProjectJS()`
This way is used when we just want to get an instance Project.
- `ProjectJS(require('express')())`
This way is used to get an instance of Project and to apply all the setup for server such as where views and routes files are placed, which view engine is used and how logging for http access is done.
- `ProjectJS(require('express')(), {project: AnotherProjectInstance })`
This is used when we don't want to create another Project instance but rather reusing the `AnotherProjectInstance` and to apply server settings to the instance `require('express')()` above.

### The Model in MVC
After getting an instance of Project setting object, you can access your model by `Project.Models.YourModelName`. The model name is the name of the corresponding file under _server/models_ folder. [BookShelf] framework is being used for this model layer. In short, BookShelf is a Javascript ORM for Nodejs and is built on top of [Knex] which handles the connnection pools to database. Knex is built for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite3, and Oracle. Hence, you can switch to any of these DBMS as you wish. The following settings need to be changed accordingly.

```json
	"database": {
		"client"	: "postgresql",
		"name"		: "database_name",
		"host"		: "localhost",
		"username"	: "postgres",
		"password"	: "123456"

	}
```

You can have access to the underlying knex instance by `Project.Models.\_\_knex__`. To create a new model, simply create a file with the model name and place it under _server/models_ folder. An example of the initial file content is as follows:

```javascript
module.exports = function(Project, bookshelf){
	return bookshelf.Model.extend({
		tableName: 'table_name'
	});
}
```
[BookShelf] gives plenty of examples on how to extend model definition such as one-to-one, one-to-many relationships.

### The View in MVC
Views files can be found under _frontend/views_ folder. [Handlebars] is the template engine employed for this project. You can change this by changing the code in `config/__bootstrapServer__.js`. Look for the line `serverSettings.engine('html', require('hbs').__express)`.

When you start the server, the express server is configured to look for the views and templates from _.tmp/frontend/views_ instead of the _frontend/views_ folder. The reason is that some pre-processing is required for javascript and css files to be injected before hand. Hence, if you only run `node bin/www`, this pre-processing should have taken place earlier. In order to do that, you can run `gulp` with a proper task to get this done. More on this will be explained later all.

### The Controller in MVC
Controllers can be found under _server/routes_ folder. A controller file is a node module with Project setting object passed in as a parameter and is supposed to return a dictionary with 2 keys `router` and `base`. It is easier to look into examples.

```javascript
module.exports = function(Project){
	var router = require('express').Router();
	router.get('/path', function(req, res){
		res.render('aView', {key: '123'});
	});	
	return {
		base: '/parentPath',
		router: router
	}
};
```
With the above code, a `GET /parentPath/path` request will render the view `aView.html` under _frontend/views_ folder. You can access the services and models with Project.Services and Project.Models respectively. More on how to define router can be found on [Express API].

### Services
You can define your services under _server/services_ and then access it with Project.Services.YourServiceName. The name of the service will be the corresponding file's name. Following code is to show how a service can be defined.

```javascript
module.exports = function(Project){
	var Topic = Project.Models.Topic;
	return {
		customMethod: function(fields, cb) {
			Topic.save(fields).
				then(function(topic){
					cb && cb(null, topic);
				}).
				catch(function(error){
					cb && cb(error, null);
				});
		}
	}
}
```

### Best Practices
Following are only suggestions how we can structure projects to promote reusability and code quality.

#### 1. Don't use your Model directly in the controller
Yet for simple code, it's not always necessary to use a service. However, you typically happen to have code that requires access to a few different models before rendering the result to the user. Hence, it makes sense to keep all the logic in your services and reuse them accross the application.

#### 2. Don't litter the routes
After your application reaches a certain size, your routes might end up with more than hundreds lines of code to define routes with this implementation `function(req, res){}`. What you can actually do is to create sub folders under _server/routes_ to keep the logic. For example, we can have a sub folder _server/routes/user_ to have all the javascript code related to user module and then require it.

```javascript
var func = require('./users/index.js');

router.get('/path1', func.path1);
router.get('/path2', func.path2);
router.get('/path3', func.path3);
router.get('/path4', func.path4);
router.get('/path4', func.path5);
router.get('/path6', func.path6);

```
